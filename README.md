# Portofolio-React cleaned version


My portfolio website.

Based on Udemy course The Ultimate ReactJs Responsive Portfolio Website By Ehizeex Okwuose          

I recreated the website by dealing with some problems i faced and using my own info and style.
also explore and train my git and github knowledge in this project.
The experience of this process made me understand many new methods,functions and what React js can do.

Thats a interesting part of my trial at learning react framework and honing my Developer skills.
